# üï≥Ô∏è Unity CAVE System

A modular **CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment)** generator for Unity ‚Äî designed to create immersive multi-display projection environments with configurable screen geometry, camera alignment, and real-time compositing of multiple render textures into one output texture.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üß© **Config-driven setup**  
  Build and layout the entire CAVE environment using a simple JSON configuration file.
  
- üé• **Multi-display support**  
  Each wall renders from its own camera with proper alignment and projection.

- üß± **Automatic wall generation**  
  Front, left, right, top, bottom walls are built dynamically based on configuration.

- üî≠ **View-perfect calibration**  
  Cameras are positioned and rotated so that projected 3D objects transition seamlessly across walls.

- üñºÔ∏è **Merged render texture output**  
  All wall render textures are combined into one final composite texture ‚Äî suitable for streaming, recording, or network transport.

- üïπÔ∏è **Root transform control**  
  The entire CAVE can be moved or rotated by manipulating the root `CAVE` GameObject in the scene.

## üß∞ Requirements

- **Unity 2021.3+**
- Built-in Render Pipeline (URP/HDRP may require small material adjustments)
- Spout plugin fot Unity: https://github.com/keijiro/KlakSpout
- C# 8.0 support

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

CAVE structure is defined in a simple JSON file:

```json
{
    "eyePosition": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
    "displays": [
        {
            "name": "Front",
            "DisplayIndex": "2",
            "width": 1.92,
            "height": 1.08,
            "textureWidth": 1920,
            "textureHeight": 1080
        },
        {
            "name": "Left",
            "DisplayIndex": "1",
            "width": 1.92,
            "height": 1.08,
            "textureWidth": 1920,
            "textureHeight": 1080
        },
        {
            "name": "Right",
            "DisplayIndex": "3",
            "width": 1.92,
            "height": 1.08,
            "textureWidth": 1920,
            "textureHeight": 1080
        }
    ]
}
```

| ------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `DisplayIndex`                  | string | Unity display index (0 = main, 1 = secondary, etc.)   |
| `width`, `height`               | float  | Physical wall size in meters                          |
| `textureWidth`, `textureHeight` | int    | Per-wall render texture resolution                    |

üß© Usage

Create empty GameObject ‚Üí name it CAVE

Attach the CAVEBuilder script

Add layer "CaveWalls" in ProjectSettings

Assign:

JSON config file path (relative or absolute)

Base material for wall surfaces

Press Play
‚Üí The system builds the walls, cameras, and render targets automatically. Also it creates SpoutSender for each wall.
